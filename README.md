# My Portfolio 

## Purpose
To showcase my work for prospective employers and clients. This page demonstrates my earliest projects as well as a brief "about-me" and contact information. 

## Notes
* Please note that all projects except for 'Run-Buddy' are placeholders and do not contain a link. These will be replaced in the future. 
* Run-Buddy link is fully functional. 
* I referenced my Run-Buddy code to guide me in a general direction. All sections were modified appropriately. 
* HTML and CSS were commented according to section for ease of navigation. 
* Media Query breakpoints available for 924px and 575px. I found these breakpoints to be the most suitable on the level of content on my page. 
* I consolidated my code to the best of my abilities by using class attributes and flexbox.
